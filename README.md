**Automatic Classification of Modulation Schemes Under Blind Scenario**

**Introduction**

This repository contains the final year project for the University, titled "Automatic Classification of Modulation Schemes Under Blind Scenario." The project aims to develop a machine learning-based artificial intelligence system to automatically identify and classify digital modulation schemes used in wireless communication systems, specifically BPSK, BASK, and BFSK systems.

**Problem Statement**

In wireless communication systems, identifying the modulation scheme used in a received signal can be challenging, especially in blind scenarios where prior information about the signal is not available. The project focuses on addressing this problem by developing a robust algorithm that can classify modulation types based on the received constellation diagram.

**Aim**

The primary aim of this project is to design and implement a Machine Learning-based artificial intelligence system that can automatically identify and classify digital modulation schemes, specifically BPSK, BASK, and BFSK, from a received signal without prior knowledge about the modulation scheme.

**Objectives**

The specific objectives of this project are as follows:

    Develop Robust Algorithm: Create an algorithm that uses machine learning techniques such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify modulation types based on the constellation diagram of the received signal.

    Implement Software-Defined Radio (SDR) System: Implement a Software-Defined Radio (SDR) based BPSK, BASK, and BFSK system to obtain real-time data for training and testing the classification algorithms.

    Compare Algorithm Accuracy: Evaluate and compare the accuracy of the developed machine learning algorithms in classifying modulation schemes. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and identify the best-performing algorithm.

**Conclusion**

This project aims to contribute to the field of wireless communication systems by developing a robust artificial intelligence system for automatic modulation classification under blind scenarios. By accurately identifying modulation schemes without prior knowledge, this system can enhance the efficiency and reliability of wireless communication networks.

**This project is under development.**
